spam,"For this month’s code jam, just draw!
Drawing on the computer is one of the greatest joys that modern day technology has brought us, and another one is seeing art that people have made using tools you’ve created. This month’s code jam is all about those joys: drawing, making art, making tools to help others make art…just…draw!

Head to glitch.com/jams right now to learn more about what jams are, how to submit your projects, and see what the community made for past jams. And a huge shout out goes to all of you who made so many #waves last month!

We can’t wait to see what you create! ✍️

 See you on glitch.com/jams
